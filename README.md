# Tykto NFT Ticketing Platform

# TyktoPlatform
TyktoPlatform is a smart contract designed for creating and claiming tickets on the Tykto NFT Ticketing Platform. This platform allows users to securely manage event tickets as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the blockchain. The TyktoPlatform contract handles the ticket creation, ownership, and verification processes.

# Features
Ticket Creation: The contract provides a function to create new tickets for events. Each ticket is represented as an ERC721 NFT and has a unique identifier and metadata associated with it.

Ticket Claiming: Once a ticket is created, it can be claimed by a user using their wallet address. This process establishes the ownership of the ticket and associates it with the user's address.

# TyktoMart
TyktoMart is a smart contract that facilitates the buying and selling of tickets listed as NFTs on the Tykto NFT Ticketing Platform. It acts as a marketplace where users can browse and purchase tickets for various events.

# Features
Ticket Listing: Users can list their tickets for sale on the TyktoMart marketplace. The tickets are represented as ERC721 NFTs and can be priced accordingly.

Ticket Purchase: Interested buyers can browse the marketplace, view available tickets, and purchase them using the specified price. The ownership of the ticket is transferred to the buyer upon successful purchase.

# TyktoToken
TyktoToken is an ERC20 smart contract responsible for managing the platform's native tokens. These tokens are used to reward users who claim entry to events by burning their Tykto NFT tickets.

# Features
Token Generation: The TyktoToken contract enables the creation of ERC20 tokens, which are distributed to users as rewards.

Reward Distribution: When a user claims entry to an event by burning their Tykto NFT ticket, they receive a specified amount of TyktoTokens as a reward. This incentivizes users to participate in events using the Tykto NFT Ticketing Platform.

# TyktoNft
TyktoNft is an ERC721 smart contract that represents the NFT ticket itself. Each ticket is a unique NFT token that can be minted, listed for sale, and purchased on the Tykto NFT Ticketing Platform.

# Features
Ticket Minting: The TyktoNft contract allows the minting of new NFT tickets. Each ticket has a unique identifier and associated metadata that provides information about the event.

Ticket Listing and Sale: Users can list their NFT tickets for sale on the TyktoNft marketplace. Interested buyers can browse the available tickets and purchase them using the specified price.

Ownership Transfer: When a ticket is purchased, the ownership of the NFT is transferred from the seller to the buyer. This transfer of ownership is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
